This supernatural entity first appears to Scrooge, inducing a moment of despair and reflection that marks the beginning of Scrooge's transformation. Marley's Ghost is not just a harbinger of the visits from other spirits; it actively engages Scrooge in a process of learning and understanding by showing him visions of the past. These scenes from his life and others' are not merely memories but are imbued with emotional significance, prompting Scrooge to engage in deep conversation about his observations and the lessons to be learned from them.\n\nMarley's Ghost's ability to show Scrooge \"shadows of things that have been\" underscores its role as more than a mere guide; it is a catalyst for change, pushing Scrooge to confront his past actions and their implications.
